Q1. Please share information about database backup stretegy and backup tool in use.


Q2. default_statistics_target:
    current value: 100
	Recommended Value: 10000 
	Actual number of rows scanned for statistics update= default_statistics_target * 300

Q3. Please enable below parameters for logging troubleshooting information.
	log_duration 
	log_statement  = ddl
	log_statement_stats = on
	
Q4. What is reason to set very high values for 
 autovacuum_freeze_max_age           | 1000,000,000
 vacuum_freeze_table_age             | 800,000,000 	
 
  By default, vacuum_freeze_table_age = 100,000,000 (one hundred million), and autovacuum_freeze_max_age = 200,000,000 (two hundred million).
  
Q5. effective_io_concurrency :Sets the number of concurrent disk I/O operations that PostgreSQL expects can be executed simultaneously.
    current value: 1
	Recommended Value: 8. This is single socket, 16 cpu core server. It should comfortably support 8 parallel operations per session.

Q6. max_parallel_workers_per_gather: the number of workers that can assist a sequential scan of a table;
    Current Value : 0
    Recommended Value: 2
  
Q7. backend_flush_after: Whenever more than backend_flush_after bytes have been written by a single backend, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the 
	                     underlying storage. Doing so will limit the amount of dirty data in the kernel's page cache, reducing the likelihood of stalls when an fsync is issued at the end of a checkpoint, or when the OS writes data back in larger batches in the background.   
	current Value: 0
	Recommended Value: 512kB
	
Q8. track_io_timing	

Q9. log_hostname
