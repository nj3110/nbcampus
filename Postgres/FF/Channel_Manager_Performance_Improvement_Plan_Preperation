--------------------------------------------------------
 default_statistics_target:
current value: 100
Recommended Value: 10000
We have few tables with n million of records. Current configuration is not efficient to collect statistics required for efficient execution plan.

2. autovacuum_freeze_max_age
current value: 1000,000,000
Recommended value: 200,000,000

vacuum_freeze_table_age
current value: 800,000,000
Recommended value : 190,000,000 [ db will auto adjust value to 95% of autovacuum_freeze_max_age]

We have seen few occurrence of POSTGRES_AUTOVAC_FREEZE CRITICAL. Thus it's high time to adjust these parameters.

3. effective_io_concurrency
Current value : 1
Recommended Value: 8
Database server is dual threaded with 32 cpu's. This it should happily support i/o concurrency.

max_parallel_workers_per_gather
current value : 0
Recommended value: 4

backend_flush_after
current value : 0
Recommended value : 512Kb.

4. Enable log_statement_stats and track_io_timing
